# Machine-Learning Project: Fingerprint spoofing detection
## Description
 The goal of the project is the development of a classi er to detect whether a ngerprint image represents
 an authentic ngerprint or a spoofed ngerprint, i.e. a ngerprint image obtained by cloning, possibly
 with di erent methods, the ngerprint of an individual. The ngerprint images are represented by
 means of embeddings, i.e. low-dimensional representations of images obtained by mapping images to a
 low-dimensional manifold (typically few hundred dimensions). To keep the model tractable, the dataset
 consists of synthetic data, and embeddings have signi cantly lower dimension than in real use-cases.
 The embeddings are 10-dimensional, continuous-valued vectors, belonging to either the authentic
 ngerprint (label 1) or the spoofed ngerprint (label 0) class. The embedding components do not have
 a physical interpretation.
 File Train.txt contains the embeddings that can be employed to build the classi cation model
 (training set). The evaluation embeddings (evaluation set) are provided in le Test.txt. Each row of
 each le correspond to a sample. The features and corresponding label of each sample are separated by
 commas, with the rst 10 columns of each le corresponding to the sample components, whereas the last
 column contains the corresponding label.
 The datasets are imbalanced, with the spoofed ngerprint class having signi cantly more samples.
 The spoofed ngerprint samples belong to one of 6 possible sub-classes, corresponding to di erent spoof
ing approaches, but the actual spoo ng method (sub-class label) is not available. The target application
 considers an application where prior probabilities of authentic and spoofed classes are the same, but
 labeling a spoofed ngerprint as authentic has a larger cost due to the security vulnerabilities that
 such errors would create. The target application working point is threrefore de ned by the triplet
 ( T =05Cfn =1Cfp =10).
 ##  Model training and model selection
 The report should provide an analysis of the dataset and of suitable models for the task, and the
 methodology employed to select a candidate solution among di erent possible alternatives (e.g. di erent
 classi cation models, di erent values of the hyperparameters, di erent pre-processing strategies).
 The models must be trained over the training set only. When needed, validation data can be extracted
 from the training set (for example, to compare competing models, to select suitable values for the
 hyperparameters of each model, or to train score calibration models). Models should be trained to
 optimize the target application, but performance of the models for alternative applications should also
 be analyzed and discussed. At the end of this stage, a candidate solution should be provided for the
 classi cation task.
 ##  Evaluation of the candidate model
  The proposed solution must be evaluated on the evaluation set. The evaluation samples should be treated
 as independent, i.e. the value or the score of an evaluation sample should have no inuence on the score
 of a di erent sample. The evaluation should report the performance in terms of the primary metric, but
 also analyze how the model would perform for alternative applications (i.e. alternative working points).

 ## Post-evaluation analysis
The choices made during model training should be analyzed to verify that the selected model is indeed
 competitive for the task. This requires comparing on the evaluation set alternative models that were
 analyzed and trained, but discarded, in the rst phase, to verify whether the proposed solution is indeed
 optimal or close to optimal with respect to possible alternatives (e.g., the chosen models is e ective, the
 chosen hyperparameters are optimal, etc.).
